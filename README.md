# Sudoku SolverðŸ§©
Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle that involves placing numbers in a 9x9 grid to solve a constraint satisfaction problem. The puzzle is divided into nine 3x3 boxes, also called regions, blocks, or boxes. The goal is to fill the grid so that each row, column, and box contains the numbers 1â€“9 without repeating any numbers. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid with a single solution. 

This is a web-based Sudoku Solver built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The solver can take any standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as input, validate the board, and solve it. The project also includes features to clear the board and handle invalid inputs.

## Features

- **Solve Sudoku Puzzles:** Automatically solves any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
- **Clear Board:** Clears the board to allow for a new puzzle.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures only valid numbers (1-9) are entered into the cells.

## How It Works

- **User Interface:** The board is a 9x9 grid where users can input the numbers for their Sudoku puzzle.
- **Solver Logic:** The core solving algorithm is implemented in JavaScript, utilizing a backtracking approach to fill in the board.
- **Input Handling:** The script ensures that only valid numbers are entered, and the grid cells are automatically updated when the puzzle is solved.
